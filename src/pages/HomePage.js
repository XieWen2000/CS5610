      <h1>Welcome to Conway's Game of Life</h1>
      <p>
        Conway's Game of Life is a 'zero-player game' developed by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.
        The game is a cellular automaton, and it consists of a grid of cells which can live, die or multiply based on a set of mathematical rules.
      </p>
      <h2>Rules of the Game</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>A living cell with less than two living neighbours dies (as if caused by underpopulation).</li>
        <li>A living cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.</li>
        <li>A living cell with more than three live neighbours dies (as if by overpopulation).</li>
        <li>A dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell (as if by reproduction).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The initial pattern constitutes the 'seed' of the system. The first generation is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the seedâ€”births and deaths occur simultaneously.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through these simple rules, the Game of Life can produce a vast array of patterns. Some that are stable, some that oscillate, and others that move across the board.
